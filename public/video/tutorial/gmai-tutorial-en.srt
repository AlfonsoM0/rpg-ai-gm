7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,240
thrilling adventures. First, imagine that

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,520
they are, something powerful, elegant, or

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,240
mysterious. Then, bring them to life by

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320

their profession, personality and

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
equipment. Will they have special powers?

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,680
Don't hold back. Remember, you can use

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
voice dictation to make creation easier,

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,360
and I can help you enhance your

description to make it truly

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
unforgettable. To begin, you have

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
experience points. Use them wisely to

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
improve your character's attributes:

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,560
strength, intelligence, charisma. Each

24
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,280
point counts. Before we begin our

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,520
adventure, I recommend personalizing your

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,200
experience. Adjust my play style and my

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,040
voice in the settings. You can choose

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,200
between a rules-based style or one where

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,680
imagination runs wild. Create shortcuts

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
to quickly access common actions like

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,680
suggest adventure ideas or I want to

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,040
perform more attribute tests. Personalize

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,440
your experience. Choose a visual theme

34
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,160
that transports youworld of adventure, an

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,040
enchanted forest, a futuristic city, or a

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,680
dark dungeon. With everything ready, it's

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,160

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,840
I will offer you options, but don't

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,120

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
on your character sheet so I can see your

47
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,760

48
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,560
ends when your character accumulates 3

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
failures or five successes in these

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,800

00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,960

point reward. If you give your story a

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,120
name, it will be saved in your personal

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160

57
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160

to see what stories you create.

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
Thunder cracks, echoing the beat of war

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,880
drums as a torrent of rain falls upon the

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,240
assembled army. Lightning illuminates

68
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,280
Maximo standing before them, his silver

69
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,720
armor gleaming, eyes burning with

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,520
righteous fury. He raises his sword, the

71
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,640
Holy Perger, now crackling with celestial

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,360
energy. Brothers and sisters in arms, his

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
voice booms across the battlefield,

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,040
amplified by the storm raging above.

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,640
Today we stand upon the precipice of

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,320
oblivion. The necromancer Aggregon

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,320
returns to shroud our world in eternal

78
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
darkness. He sends for his legions of the

79
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,200
damned, thinking to break us to enslave

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
our souls...
